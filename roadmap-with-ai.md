## 💡 **EXAMPLE PROMPTS**

### **Example 1: Brazil Launch Help**

```
[...paste full template above...]

CURRENT MARKETING ROADMAP PHASE:
PHASE 2: Regional Dominance - Brazil (Week 3)

CURRENT STATUS:
- Blog posts published: 5 in Portuguese
- Website visitors: 200 (mostly from crypto Twitter)
- Wallet connections: 15
- GPU owners signed up: 2
- Renters signed up: 8
- Successful rentals: 0
- Traffic sources: 80% Twitter, 20% Reddit

WHAT I NEED HELP WITH:
I'm struggling to get GPU owners to list their GPUs in Brazil. I've posted in gaming forums but only got 2 responses. What am I doing wrong? Should I change my messaging? Should I offer better incentives? How do I find Brazilian GPU owners who would actually list?

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. Is my current messaging appealing enough to GPU owners?
2. Where else can I find Brazilian gamers/miners with high-end GPUs?
3. Should I offer 100% revenue for first month (0% platform fee)?
4. Am I moving too fast? Should I get more renters first?
```

### **Example 2: Content Strategy Help**

```
[...paste full template above...]

CURRENT MARKETING ROADMAP PHASE:
PHASE 2: Regional Dominance - Brazil (Week 4)

- Wallet connections: 50
- GPU owners signed up: 8
- Renters signed up: 40
- Successful rentals: 3
- Traffic sources: 40% SEO, 30% Reddit, 30% direct

WHAT I NEED HELP WITH:
My blog posts are getting traffic but not converting to wallet connections. People read the posts but don't click through to the site. How do I improve my CTAs? Should I add more CTAs within the posts? Should I change the post structure? Should I focus on different topics?

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. What's a good conversion rate from blog reader → site visitor?
2. How should I structure blog posts to drive conversions?
3. Should I add more "how-to" content vs "why" content?
4. Are 20 posts enough or should I write 50+ before expecting results?
```

### **Example 3: Scaling Advice**

```
[...paste full template above...]

CURRENT MARKETING ROADMAP PHASE:
PHASE 5: Scale & Automate (Week 16)

CURRENT STATUS:
- Blog posts published: 150 across 6 languages
- Website visitors: 20,000/month
- Wallet connections: 500
- GPU owners signed up: 50
- Renters signed up: 300

- Revenue: $2,000/month
- Traffic sources: 60% SEO, 20% Reddit, 10% Twitter, 10% direct

WHAT I NEED HELP WITH:
I'm at $2K/month revenue but stuck. Growth has plateaued. I have good supply (50 GPUs) and decent demand (300 renters) but utilization is only 20%. Most GPUs sit idle. How do I increase utilization? Should I lower prices? Should I focus on marketing to renters? Should I add new features?

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. What's the typical utilization rate for marketplaces like this?
2. Is my problem supply, demand, or pricing?
3. Should I focus on getting more renters or more GPU owners?
4. At what revenue level should I consider raising funding vs staying bootstrapped?
5. Is $2K/month good for Month 4, or am I behind?
```

## ✅ **VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

Before asking AI "is this a good idea?", check these:

```
Product-Market Fit Signals (GOOD):
✓ People are actually renting GPUs (not just signing up)
✓ Repeat rentals happening (same users coming back)
✓ GPU owners re-listing (they made money, want more)
✓ Organic word-of-mouth (people sharing without you asking)
✓ Low churn (users don't disappear after first rental)

Red Flags (BAD):
✗ Lots of signups, no rentals (fake demand)
✗ One-time renters only (no retention)
✗ GPU owners delist after first rental (bad experience)
✗ All traffic is paid (no organic growth)
✗ High support burden (constant hand-holding)

At Each Phase Gate, Ask:
├─> Did we hit the success criteria?
├─> If not, why not? (wrong channel? wrong message? wrong market?)
├─> Should we pivot, persist, or kill this phase?
└─> What did we learn that changes our assumptions?
```

---

## 🔥 **IS THIS A GOOD IDEA? (Framework)**

Instead of asking AI to validate, ask yourself:

### **The 10-Question Test:**

```
1. Are people paying for this? (not just interested, PAYING)
   └─> If YES → good sign
   └─> If NO → why not?

2. Is it growing without paid ads?
   └─> If YES → organic demand exists
   └─> If NO → might be pushing a boulder uphill

3. Are users telling others about it?
   └─> If YES → word of mouth = product-market fit
   └─> If NO → not exciting enough yet

4. Are you uniquely positioned to win this market?
   └─> Your advantage: 13 languages, crypto-native, first-mover
   └─> Competitor's advantage: More GPUs, more users, more funding
   └─> Who wins in 2 years?

5. Is the market big enough?
   └─> TAM (Total Addressable Market): GPU rental for AI
   └─> Crypto-native users: ~200K potential customers
   └─> Non-English markets: 5B people (much bigger)
   └─> Can you get to $1M+ revenue? If yes, big enough.

6. Can you defend this if competitors copy you?
   └─> Moat: First-mover in 13 languages, smart contract trust
   └─> Risk: Vast.ai adds crypto payments (easy for them)
   └─> Defense: Community, brand, regional dominance

7. Does this energize you or drain you?
   └─> If energized → keep going
   └─> If drained → might be wrong founder-market fit

8. Are you learning and improving each week?
   └─> If YES → you're on a growth trajectory
   └─> If NO → might be stuck in local maximum

9. Would you use this yourself?
   └─> If YES → you understand the customer
   └─> If NO → you're guessing at pain points

10. If this fails, what did you learn that's valuable?
    └─> If answer is rich → fail fast, learn, apply elsewhere
    └─> If answer is "nothing" → reconsider the bet
```

**If you score 7+/10 YES answers → good idea, keep going**

**If you score 4-6/10 → risky, but might work with pivots**

**If you score <4/10 → probably wrong idea or wrong execution**

---

## 🎯 **YOUR UNIQUE ADVANTAGE**

Why going after worldwide (non-English) first is GENIUS:

```
Traditional startup playbook (WRONG for you):
├─> Launch in US/English market
├─> Compete with well-funded startups
├─> Get crushed by Vast.ai's 10,000 GPUs
├─> Realize you can't compete on supply
└─> Give up

Your playbook (SMART):
├─> Launch in Brazil/Mexico/France (no competition)
├─> Dominate SEO in those languages
├─> Build brand as "decentralized GPU marketplace"
├─> Get 1,000 users across 6 markets
├─> THEN enter English market with traction
└─> Raise funding or sell with proof

This is called "regional beachhead strategy"
It's how Uber, Airbnb, and others scaled globally.

Start small (one city/country), dominate it, then expand.
```

---

## 🚀 **FINAL REALITY CHECK**

AI will ALWAYS say your idea is great (to be encouraging).

AI will ALSO say it's not great (when you express doubt).

**AI mirrors your sentiment. It's a reflection tool, not a truth oracle.**

**Here's what actually matters:**

```
Week 1: Did anyone rent a GPU?
├─> YES → validate more
├─> NO → change something

Week 4: Are people renting repeatedly?
├─> YES → you have product-market fit
├─> NO → improve product or find better customers

Week 12: Are you making $1K+/month?
├─> YES → you have a business
├─> NO → diagnose: supply? demand? pricing? trust?

Week 24: Are you growing without you pushing?
├─> YES → you found something scalable
├─> NO → might need to pivot or add more distribution channels

The market tells you if it's a good idea.
Not AI. Not me. Not your friends.

USERS PAYING = GOOD IDEA
USERS NOT PAYING = BAD IDEA (or bad execution)
```

## ✅ **SAVE THIS PROMPT**

Every time you're stuck, paste this:

```
I'm building a decentralized GPU rental marketplace.

Here's where I am:
[PHASE X, Week Y]

Here's what I've done:
- [metric 1]
- [metric 2]
- [metric 3]

Here's what I'm stuck on:
[YOUR SPECIFIC PROBLEM]

Here's what I've tried:

- [attempt 2]

Here's what I'm considering:

2. What am I not seeing?
3. What would you do in my shoes?
